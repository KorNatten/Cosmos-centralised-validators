A list of centralised validators and exchange accounts on the Cosmos Hub


How I did it.
Extract validators.json from .....

Checked manually on mintscan.io
-added collumn with VOTE_OPTION according to the same values in https://github.com/gnolang/independence-day/tree/main/prop69
-added "nil" for validators that did not vote
-searched for different monikers bassed on addresses
-added collumn with remarks
